# DMIT1530 Assignment 1

This assignment is worth 15% of your final mark.

Assignment one is a three page, responsive layout. The student will create the site using best practice techniques for web and a typical framework with a reset of their choice.

Each page will have three different layouts.
1. Smallest Screen Size starting at 320px
2.	Medium Screen Size starting at 800px
3.	Large Screen Size starting at 1300px

Font sizing will be coded with relative units and render to the following px values on the screen:
- Paragraphs = 18px
-	Heading h1 = 44px
-	Heading h2 = 35px
-	Heading h3 = 28px
-	Heading h4 = 22px

Each page will have fluid, edge-to-edge content for both the small and medium screen sizes. These screen sizes will have spacing of 16px on the left and right sides. Starting at 1300px the content will then become contained in a fixed-width, centered container. There will be no left and right spacing within the fixed-width container. Background images and background colors will fill 100% screen width.

The home page has three columns of text that will become three equal width columns along one row for screens wider than 800px. The next row will have an image that takes up 1/3 of the space and a column of text that will take 2/3 of the space. These columns will have 2% spacing between them.

The gallery page has four rows of content that will stack on the smallest screen and then adjust on the medium screen to match the provided screenshots. There is 2% of spacing between the items within the rows.

The blog page has five blog posts that have stacking content on the smallest screen. The content in the blog post adjusts on medium screens to match the provided screenshots. On the medium screen the order of the content will need to switch for the even numbered blog posts.

Students will attempt efficient CSS by using advanced CSS selectors and will resize and compress all images.
